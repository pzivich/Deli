Examples
=====================================

Here, I will go through a variety of examples (using custom estimating equations, rather than the built-in options).
These examples follow Chapter 7 of Boos & Stefanski. If you have the book (or access to it), then reading along with
each section may be helpful. To make it easier, I also provide the section heading from Chapter 7.
