Delicatessen
=====================================

``delicatessen`` is a one-stop shop for all your sandwich (variance) needs. This Python 3.8+ library supports
M-estimation, which is a general statistical framework for estimating unknown parameters. If you are an R user, I
recommend looking into ``geex`` (`Saul & Hudgens (2020) <https://bsaul.github.io/geex/>`_).
``delicatessen`` supports a variety of pre-built estimating equations as well as custom, user built estimating
equations.

Here, we provide a brief overview of M-Estimation. For a more detailed, please refer to Stefanski & Boos (2002) or
Boos & Stefanski (2013). M-estimation was developed to study the large sample properties of robust statistics. However,
many common large-sample statistics can be expressed with estimating equations, so M-estimation provides a unified
structure and a streamlined approach to estimation. Let the parameter of interest be the
vector :math:`\theta = (\theta_1, \theta_2, ..., \theta_v)` and data is observed for :math:`n` independent units
:math:`O_1, O_2, â€¦, O_n`. An M-estimator, :math:`\hat{\theta}`, is the solution to the estimating equation
:math:`\sum_{i=1}^{n} \psi(O_i, \hat{\theta}) = 0` where :math:`\psi` is a known :math:`v \times 1`-dimension estimating
function. M-estimators further provides a convenient and automatic method of calculating large-sample variance
estimators via the empirical sandwich variance estimator:

.. math::

    V_n(O,\hat{\theta}) = B_n(O,\hat{\theta})^{-1} F_n(O,\hat{\theta}) \left(B_n(O,\hat{\theta})^{-1}\right)^T

where the 'bread' is

.. math::

    B_n(O,\hat{\theta}) = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n - \psi'(O_i, \hat{\theta})

where the :math:`\psi'` indicates the partial derivative, and the 'filling' is

.. math::

    F_n(O, \hat{\theta}) = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \psi(O_i, \hat{\theta}) \psi(O_i, \hat{\theta})^T

While M-Estimation is a general approach, widespread application is hindered by the corresponding derivative and matrix
calculations. To circumvent these barriers, ``delicatessen`` automates M-estimators using numerical approximation
methods.

The following description is a high-level overview. The user provides a :math:`v \times n` array of estimating
function(s) to the ``MEstimator`` class object. Next, the ``MEstimator`` object solves for :math:`\hat{\theta}` using a
root-finding algorithm. After successful completion of the root-finding, the bread is computed by numerically
approximating the partial derivatives and the filling is calculated. Finally, the empirical sandwich variance is
computed.

Installation:
-------------

To install ``delicatessen``, use the following command in terminal or command prompt

``python -m pip install delicatessen``

Only two dependencies for ``delicatessen`` are: ``NumPy``, ``SciPy``.

While pandas is not necessary, several examples are demonstrated with pandas for ease of data processing. To replicate
the tests in ``tests/`` you will need to install ``pandas``, ``statsmodels`` and ``pytest`` (but these are not necessary
for use of the package).
